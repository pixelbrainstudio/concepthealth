Future upgrades:
I focused only on the actual specification but made a more usable structure for additional developments. I using similar in the final products. I can suggest improvements with additional requirements specification (for example handling multiple balls, add sound effects for other events like a tap on the ball) Currently for not overcomplicating the movements I have restricted the ball movement to the X/Y axis.
